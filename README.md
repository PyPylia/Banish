# Banish
A small datapack for 1.20.2+ that allows your SMP to vote on banishing your enemies to an alternate nether dimension.  
This banished nether is a distinct dimension to the regular nether, making it impossible to access or escape via normal means.

## How to use
Type `/trigger banish`, it's that easy. Just click on someone's name to banish them, or click the admin dashboard for more options.

### How to escape
If you are unlucky enough to be banished, you must start from scratch to collect enough resources to make and use a respawn anchor.  
Your items will be given back to you when you escape.
> p.s. _Any ender pearls outside the banished nether are disabled while you are inside it._  
> p.p.s. _Obstructing your spawnpoint won't work._

### Admin - Banish threshold
Controls what percentage of players need to vote on someone before they get banished.

### Admin - Cruel mode
When enabled, the banished player spawns on the nether roof instead, making it even harder (although technically not impossible) to escape.
